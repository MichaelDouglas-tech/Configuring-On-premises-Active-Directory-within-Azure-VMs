Think of Active Directory (AD) like a school office:

It has a list of all the students (users) and teachers (computers).

It makes sure only the right people get into the right classrooms (permissions).

It can also give rules — like “everyone must wear a badge” (policies).

So, when we put AD in Azure, we’re just moving that office into a cloud-based computer.

2. Step 1 – Create a Virtual Machine (Your Cloud Computer)

First, in Azure, you create a VM, which is just like renting a computer in the cloud.

Imagine this like renting an apartment online — it’s empty until you set it up.

We’ll pick Windows Server because that’s what can run Active Directory.

3. Step 2 – Install Active Directory Role

Once the VM is running, log in like you would log into your laptop.

Then you add the Active Directory Domain Services role.

Think of this like telling your empty apartment, “Hey, you’re now the school office.”

This step transforms the VM into a Domain Controller (the main computer in charge of the list and rules).

4. Step 3 – Create Your Domain

A domain is just a name for your network, like “mycompany.local.”

This is like giving your school a name — “Sunshine Academy.”

Every user or computer that joins the domain becomes part of that school.

5. Step 4 – Add Users and Groups

In Active Directory, you can create users (employees), groups (teams), and set their permissions.

Example: put all customer service staff in one group, give them access only to the helpdesk system.

Think of this like giving students lockers and keys that fit only their hallway.

6. Step 5 – Connect Devices

Finally, computers (even other Azure VMs or office PCs) can “join the domain.”

Once joined, the domain controls logins, permissions, and rules.

This is like telling students: “Now you log in with your school ID, not your personal one.”# Configuring-On-premises-Active-Directory-within-Azure-VMs
